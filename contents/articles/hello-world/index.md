My new years resolutions as a list included writing more, in particular more
than would fit in three tweets. It is about time I have a new outlet for some
of my technological investigations, so here we go again!

I'm trying out [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io), a static site generator
in the same category as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). After literally a year of
stalling, I finally decided I would prefer to be publishing over waiting to have
the perfect theme, which of course means now I'm publishing but on the default
theme - with just enough changes to get the output formatted as I would like.

This will probably cover technology and not my life, my friends, or my
(adorable) puppy. Unless, of course, people start requesting more puppy
pictures!
